# Overview
*A video game company has to open a new office. The goal of the project is to identify the best place to install it*

The company will have the following scheme:
​
- 20 Designers
- 5 UI/UX Engineers
- 10 Frontend Developers
- 15 Data Engineers
- 5 Backend Developers
- 20 Account Managers
- 1 Maintenance guy that loves basketball
- 10 Executives
- 1 CEO/President\
​
All employees were asked to show their preferences on where to place the new office.
In the project we will try to find a place that covers more or less all the following requirements.

1) Designers like to share knowledge. There must be some nearby companies that also do design.
2) Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not to far.
3) Account managers need to travel a lot
4) All people in the company have between 25 and 40 years, give them some place to go to party.
5) If you want to make the maintenance guy happy, a basketball stadium must be around 10 Km.

# Knowledge

For this project I use databases in MongoDB, I make queries and geoqueries to those databases. 
Through the geographic coordinates WGS84 (lat and long) it is possible to geolocalize Markers and display them in dynamic maps created with the folium library, or in tableau.
